Use Deep Learning in Data Assimilation

TorchDA is a Python package that provides a flexible and user-friendly
framework for performing data assimilation with neural networks on
various algorithms, including Kalman Filter (KF),
Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF),
3D Variational (3D-Var) assimilation, and
4D Variational (4D-Var) assimilation.

This package is designed to simplify the process of configuring and
executing data assimilation cases, making it easier for researchers
and practitioners to apply data assimilation techniques with
neural networks to their scientific and engineering problems.

Modules
-------
- parameters:
    Contains the Parameters class for specifying data assimilation parameters.
- builder:
    Provides a CaseBuilder class for configuring and
    executing data assimilation cases.
- executor:
    Implements the _Executor class for executing data assimilation cases.
- kalman_filter:
    Implements EnKF and Kalman Filter algorithms for data assimilation.
- variational:
    Implements 3D-Var and 4D-Var algorithms for variational data assimilation.

For more information, please refer to the package documentation.
